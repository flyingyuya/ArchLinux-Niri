You can customize the plugins via the `Ice.plugins` table.

## Customizing a Plugin

Each plugin installed corresponds to a key-value pair in `Ice.plugins`. For example, if you want to customize `hop.nvim`, just make modifications to `Ice.plugins.hop`. The names used in `Ice.plugins` can be found in the [utilities/plugins](../../utilities/plugins) section, but with auto-completion enabled default, you can just navigate through the completion menu after typing `Ice.plugins.` to find the field name of a certain plugin.

Each value in these pairs is a lazy.nvim-compatible plugin spec. Pretty much everything is the same as when you are using lazy, but instead of returning it, we are storing it in `Ice.plugins`.

You can also remove a plugin by setting it to `nil` or add a plugin that is not present in IceNvim.

For example:

```lua
local view = Ice.plugins["nvim-tree"].opts.view
view.number = true
view.relativenumber = true

Ice.plugins.avante = nil -- disables avante

-- Field name does not matter when adding a new plugin
Ice.plugins.aaa = {
    "folke/zen-mode.nvim",
}
```

!!! warning

    Most of the time, IceNvim only uses configuration included by the original plugin. The only exception is nvim-treesitter.

    In a recent update, nvim-treesitter removed the `ensure_installed` field. IceNvim, however, persists on using this field to automatically install parser. It is also highly unrecommended to use other ways to install parser, e.g., via the `TSInstall` command, because IceNvim has made special tweaks to only enable treesitter support for buffers whose filetype has a corresponding parser.

    For example, you can install the parser for swift like this:

    ```lua
    table.insert(Ice.plugins["nvim-treesitter"].opts.ensure_installed, "swift")
    ```

## Lazy Loading a Plugin

If you are familiar with lazy.nvim, you should know about the `VeryLazy` event and how it is used to lazy load a plugin. IceNvim is built with performance in mind and also further provides some custom events to help boost loading.

### `IceLoad` Event

`IceLoad` is triggered after the colorscheme is loaded and well after the `VeryLazy` event. However, if the current buffer is an unnamed buffer or it is the dashboard, the triggering of `IceLoad` will be postponed to the next time we enter a buffer. If the next buffer is still a dashboard / unnamed buffer, the triggering is further postponed.

Note that `IceLoad` is a custom event, so when using it in the lazy.nvim `event` field, it should be prefixed with a `User `. For example:

```lua
Ice.plugins.avante.event = "User IceLoad"
```

### `IceAfter` Event

`IceAfter` is intended for scenarios where the loading order of two plugins are critical.

For example, in IceNvim, rainbow-delimiter loads with nvim-treesitter as it requires a tree-sitter parser to work. Another plugin, indent-blankline, requires rainbow-delimiter to load first to enable colorful indentation markers. Therefore, IceNvim needs to ensure that indent-blankline loads after nvim-treesitter.

With `IceAfter`, this would be easy. You can just fire a `User IceAfter nvim-treesitter` event after nvim-treesitter is loaded and set the `event` for indent-blankline to `User IceAfter nvim-treesitter`:

```lua
Ice.plugins["nvim-treesitter"] = {
    -- ...
    config = function (_, opts) {
      -- Setting up nvim-treesitter
      vim.api.nvim_exec_autocmds("User", { pattern = "IceAfter nvim-treesitter" })
    },
}

Ice.plugins["indent-blankline"].event = "User IceAfter nvim-treesitter"
```

IceNvim also fires the `IceAfter colorscheme` after the colorscheme is set, so you can also use `User IceAfter colorscheme` to load a plugin after the colorscheme is ready (differing from `IceLoad` in that this does not care about whether you are viewing the dashboard).

## Language-Specific Configuration

As mentioned above, you can disable any plugin by setting the corresponding field to `nil`. However, it would be better if you use a different approach with a few of them. These plugins are exclusively responsible for development in a certain language, and IceNvim has a different mechanism for managing them.

IceNvim supports development for these languages: Bash / C / C++ / C# / Flutter / Go / CSS / HTML / JavaScript / Typescript / JSON / Lua / Python / Typst / Rust. Among these, some are managed by plugins while others are supported via LSPs and formatters. To provide a universal interface to managing them, IceNvim introduces the `Ice.lsp` table. Each language corresponds to a field in this table:

- `emmet-ls`
- `pyright`: python
- `tinymist`: typst
- `bash-language-server`
- `rust`
- `gopls`: go
- `clangd`: C / C++
- `css-lsp`
- `typescript-language-server`
- `html-lsp`
- `json-lsp`
- `emmylua_ls`
- `lua-language-server`
- `omnisharp`: C#
- `flutter`
- `latex`

By default, only `lua-language-server` is enabled. To enable support for a language, just set `enabled = true`:

```lua
Ice.lsp.flutter.enabled = true
```

And if you want to enable support for all these languages above, just do this:

```lua
for _, lsp in pairs(vim.tbl_keys(Ice.lsp)) do
    Ice.lsp[lsp].enabled = true
end
```

!!! note
    You should probably avoid enabling all lanauges, though, because `emmylua_ls` and `lua-language-server` are both lua language servers and you do not want both of them enabled simultaneously.

    Of these two servers, `emmylua_ls` has better performance but requires a more complicated setup. You need to:

    - install emmylua_ls via `cargo install emmylua_ls` and add `~/.cargo/bin` to $PATH
    - acquire luv via `git clone https://github.com/LuaCATS/luv` and add it to neovim runtime path (maybe under the `custom` dir)

Each language has a config table. If the table has `managed_by_plugin = true`, that language is managed by a plugin, and configuration for that language go to the corresponding `Ice.plugins` table:

- flutter: flutter-tools
- rust: rustaceanvim

Others are managed by LSPs and formatters. In this case, each table can optionally have a `formatter` and a `setup` field, where `formatter` is the name you can find by running the command `Mason` and `setup` is the configuration available to the language server. You can find out how to configure the latter value for specific languages [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md) (most of the time you really do not need that, though).

!!! note
    The `setup` value is actually of `vim.lsp.Config` type and so you can check out what values you can use by running `:h vim.lsp.Config`.

    The exception, though, is the `on_attach` function. This function runs when the lsp is attached to the buffer and takes two arguments, which are the active client and the buffer id. For example, you can do something like this:

    ```lua
    Ice.lsp.omnisharp.setup.on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
        client.server_capabilities.semanticTokensProvider = nil
    end
    ```

    This is added for compatibility concerns since back in the days when people use nvim-lspconfig to configure language servers, such a value was provided. Neovim's new lsp api renders setting up lsp with nvim-lspconfig unnecessary, but as `on_attach` is not something provided by the former, migrating from one's old configuration would prove troublesome.

    Just for some background reading, IceNvim actually implements `on_attach` via the `LspAttach` event. An alternative would have been to not implement this at all and instead ask the user to write their own autocmds, but that would be rather messy compared with the old way using `on_attach`.

You might notice that some of these languages have strange names. Why not just name it `bash` instead of `bash-language-server`? That is because these are names from `Mason` LSPs. Should you wish to add support for other languages without using a plugin, you should use the name of the LSP from `Mason` as its field name. For example, haskell's LSP is named `haskell-language-server` if you look it up in Mason. To add support for haskell, do this:

```lua
Ice.lsp["haskell-language-server"] = {} -- `formatter` and `setup` can be omitted
```

## Snippets

IceNvim supports VsCode-styled snippets. For example, if you want to create snippets that take effect in markdown files, you need to:

- create `custom/snippets/markdown.json`
- register it in `custom/snippets/package.json`
- write whatever code you like in there

The `package.json` file looks something like this:

```json
{
    "contributes": {
        "snippets": [
            {
                "language": "markdown",
                "path": "./markdown.json"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

For more information on how to write such snippets, refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/userdefinedsnippets).

## Colorschemes

Conventionally, we use the `colorscheme` command to set colorschemes. In IceNvim, as you ought to remember from the [utilities/keymaps](../../utilities/keymaps) section, we use the <kbd>&lt;C-k&gt;&lt;C-t&gt;</kbd> keymap to open a colorscheme picker. This is quite handy in that it persists across sessions. Alternatively, you can use the `IceColorscheme` command to directly set the colorscheme from the command line.

For a colorscheme to appear in this picker or to work for the `IceColorscheme` command, you need not only to install the colorscheme plugin itself, but also register it in the `Ice.colorschemes` (notice the `s` at the end) table. Each table must have a `name` value which can be used with `:colorscheme name` and a `background` field that is either `"dark"` or `"light"`.

Optionally you can have a `setup` field that:

- can be passed to the plugin's setup function if it is a table
- can be directly called when setting the colorscheme if it is a function

And a `transparent` field that, if set to `true`, will trigger the `TransparentEnable` command when this colorscheme is used.

For example:

```lua
-- gruvbox-light will appear in the colorscheme picker
Ice.colorschemes["gruvbox-light"] = {
    name = "gruvbox",
    setup = {
        italic = {
            strings = true,
            operators = false,
            comments = true,
        },
        contrast = "hard",
    },
    background = "light",
}

-- When this colorscheme is used, the background will go transparent as it has `transparent = true`
Ice.colorschemes["monet-dark"] = {
    name = "monet",
    transparent = true,
    setup = function()
        local palette = require "monet.palette"
        setmetatable(palette, { __index = palette.defaults })
    end,
    background = "dark",
},
```

If you would like a code the colorscheme in your custom config files, you can also set the colorscheme via `Ice.colorscheme`. It is a string value that is one of the available colorschemes from `Ice.colorschemes`.
