IceNvim uses a variety of plugins to guarantee a smooth editing experience.

## Plugin Manager

IceNvim uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as plugin manager. It is modern, powerful, and extremely easy to use.

Beware that the way IceNvim uses Lazy is slightly different from the official approach, which we shall see later in the [customization](./Customization) section. The majority, though, remains unchanged, which is why a little knowledge on how to use this plugin manager would be helpful should you wish to further customize Lazy in IceNvim.

## Useful Tools for Development

Apart from the necessary plugins for basic editting, IceNvim also includes several useful plugins that boost development efficiency:

- [avante](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim): use neovim like using using Cursor AI IDE; **disabled by default**

Auto completions, diagnostics, formatting, etc., are managed by these extra plugins:

- [mason](https://github.com/mason-org/mason.nvim): manage lsp / formatter sources
- [null-ls](https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim): code formatter; IceNvim actually uses none-ls, a fork of the original null-ls project
- [lspsaga](https://github.com/nvimdev/lspsaga.nvim): collection of useful lsp utilities like hover docs and displaying diagnostics

Some languages also require extra plugins (**disabled by default**):
